NGINX conf dump
===============

This was the nginx configuration of Wikijourney, as of February 2017.

It has been carefully handcrafted, and has lots of tips (regarding PHP, TLS, HTTP/2, CORS, CSP, use of snippets...) that I want to be able to recall, whenever I need to configure another host.

I will clean up everything some day, but for now it's there.

# Do NOT use in production without review!
